The people behind SISTEM are just like the majority of it&#39;s attendees - students!<br><br></p><h5 id="what-does-sistem-mean-">What does SISTEM mean?</h5><p>SISTEM is and acronym for the Students Inter Society Tech &amp; Enterprise Meetup. It&#39;s pretty self explanatory, we provide a link between Students and those in the world of Tech and Enterprise in a casual meetup environment.<br><br></p><h5 id="how-did-sistem-come-about-">How did SISTEM come about?</h5><p>SISTEM was born from the minds of students who love networking, conference styled meetups and all things tech. The societies behind SISTEM recognised that there is no event in Ireland targets topic in a way that doesn&#39;t go above most students&#39; heads. A lot of the material at conferences across the country is usually geared towards the graduates rather than the undergraduates. SISTEM is ran by a team of undergraduates, so we know what this can feel like. It can be alienating and rather off putting. Now with this said, there&#39;s many amazing conferences, meetups and summits nationwide. We take inspiration from such things, without them, this gathering of minds would not have been. In our opinion, these conferences fail to engage third-level students the way we hope to. We recognise that today&#39;s undergraduates are tomorrows graduates, so they more than deserve something that&#39;s on their level.</p></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/js/main.min.js"></script></body></html>
