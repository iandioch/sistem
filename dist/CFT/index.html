We need people of all skills levels, be that beginner, intermediate, or advanced, as students themselves range from being novices to experts. The community of Irish computing students is comprised of all skills levels, and it&#39;s only right that SISTEM reflects this fact.<br><br></p><h5 id="when-should-you-write-a-proposal-">When should you write a proposal?</h5><p>As soon as possible! The sooner you&#39;ve written a proposal, the sooner you can submit it! We review proposals as soon as they are entered. We only have a certain number of slots still free, so get your proposals in as soon as you can! The deadline is 18:00 on the 31st of January 2018. After this we won&#39;t be able to review anymore proposals as we will be in the process of further organisation for the day.<br><br></p><h5 id="where-should-you-submit-your-proposal-">Where should you submit your proposal?</h5><p>Add Google Form/Link To Google Form here.</p></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/js/main.min.js"></script></body></html>
